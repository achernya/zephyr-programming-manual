\subsubsection{ZClosePort}
\label{ZClosePort}

The ZClosePort function closes the \Zephyr\ port that was opened with
the ZOpenPort function (\myref{ZOpenPort}).  If no port was opened
with ZOpenPort, or a new file descriptor was set with ZSetFD
(\myref{ZSetFD}), no action is performed.  It is not really necessary
to call ZClosePort before an application exits, since UNIX will
automatically close all open file descriptors when a program exits.

\subsubsection{ZCancelSubscriptions}
\label{ZCancelSubscriptions-pt1}

Before an application exits, it should cancel any subscriptions
it has made.  The ZCancelSubscriptions function
(\myref{ZCancelSubscriptions}) performs this task.
